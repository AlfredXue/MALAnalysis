\begin{abstract}
In CS224 lecture, we discussed the concept of a small world - the idea that the shortest path between any two individuals
is relatively small. This has been attributed to the principle that the likelihood that two individuals know each other
correlates significantly with the geographical distance between them. Effectively, this allows each step in the shortest
path to travel a percentage of the remaining distance, which causes the shortest path to grow logarithmically with 
geographical distance, rather than linearly. 

We are curious if these principles extend to less web networks, which are generally considered to be networks that don't 
use humans as nodes, but can use their interactions to define edges. In particular, we want to study the degrees of separation 
between differing Anime, using ``myanimelist.net'' as our dataset. MyAnimeList (MAL) provides a unique opportunity to take a 
single set of nodes (anime), and multiple sets of edges that we can analyze. For example, edges can be recommendations 
from one anime to another, or a shared cast.

\section{Introduction}
The question 
\begin{quote}
``If you chose any two people in the world at random, how many acquaintances are needed to create a chain between them?''
[Kochen, 1989; Garfield 1979] 
\end{quote} 
describes the small world problem in a succinct manner. Stanley Milgram's famous postcard experiment [citation???] was the 
first experiment that attempted to measure the degrees of seperation between people in the world. To do so, he selected
a broker in Boston to be a target, and had a group of indviduals send leters to acquaintances, seeing if those letters
could eventually be routed to the Boston broker. From the results of Milgram's experiment is derived the famous 
"six degrees of seperation" phrase. 

Although there are heavy criticisms regarding the veracity of Milgram's experiments, his work clearly demonstrates two ideas.
The first is that the degrees of seperation in a human social graph are far smaller than one would intuitively think,
and the other is that the graph is \textit{navigatable}, that is, there exists some algorithm that can traverse from any
node $s$ to destination node $t$ only knowing the edges of the current node in $O(\log(N)^\beta)$ time.

The intuition for both of these properties derives from the idea that the likelihood two people know each other is strongly
correlated with their geographical distance. That is, in general, as long as the next hop is geographically closer, then our
new node has a shorter path to the destination node than our current one. However, this isn't sufficent to explain the
results of Milgram's experiments. For example, if every individual knows every other individual within a one mile radius, but
knows no one else, then the shortest path between two nodes eight hundred miles apart requires eight hundred hops -- order of 
magnitues greater than what was observed in Milgram's study. Thus the second requirement is that with high probability, our current
node will be connected to another node whose distance to the destination is no more than $\alpha << 1$ times the distance from
our current node to the destinatnion node. This allows us to travel to the desitnation much faster -- the number of hops now 
scales logarithmically rather than linerally with the distance to the destination. 

Although "six degrees of seperation" is often cited, Milgram's experiment has a few key flaws that should prevent its results
from extending to the claim that "all humans are seperated by six degrees." The first is that both the start and end nodes
were recruited from socially active people -- basically, in expectation the degrees of seperation between individuals is 
actually higher, because starting nodes and ending node should be less reachable than the ones used in the experiment. 

Nevertheless, "six degrees of seperation" is probably here to stay, and is supported by more recent analysis on the Facebook 
social network. 

The Facebook network is clearly a social graph, and maintains the properties one would expect from a social graph.
Properties such as high clustering, low degrees of seperation, and relatively low connections (i.e. number of edges << number of nodes$^2$) 
are all observed in this network. Other networks where these properties are observed includes a network of actors, where
edges are defined by having collaborated on multiple movies together, or a network of researchers, where an edge is
defined to be when two researches have collaborated on a published paper together.

On the flip side of social graphs are information graphs, or web graphs. These graphs 
% itemize
\begin{itemize}
\item To the best of our knowledge, the MMSN protocol is the first
multifrequency MAC protocol especially designed for WSNs, in which
each device is equipped with a single radio transceiver and
the MAC layer packet size is very small.
\item Instead of using pairwise RTS/CTS frequency negotiation
[Adya 2001,Culler 2001; Tzamaloukas 2001; Zhou 2006],
we propose lightweight frequency assignments, which are good choices
for many deployed comparatively static WSNs.
\item We develop new toggle transmission and snooping techniques to
enable a single radio transceiver in a sensor device to achieve
scalable performance, avoiding the nonscalable ``one
control channel + multiple data channels'' design [Natarajan 2001].
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Frequency Assignment}

We propose a suboptimal distribution to be used by each node, which is
easy to compute and does not depend on the number of competing
nodes. A natural candidate is an increasing geometric sequence, in
which
% Numbered Equation
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:01}
P(t)=\frac{b^{\frac{t+1}{T+1}}-b^{\frac{t}{T+1}}}{b-1},
\end{equation}
where $t=0,{\ldots}\,,T$, and $b$ is a number greater than $1$.

In our algorithm, we use the suboptimal approach for simplicity and
generality. We need to make the distribution of the selected back-off
time slice at each node conform to what is shown in Equation
(\ref{eqn:01}). It is implemented as follows: First, a random
variable $\alpha$ with a uniform distribution within the interval
$(0, 1)$ is generated on each node, then time slice $i$ is selected
according to the following equation:
% Unnumbered Equation
\[
i=\lfloor(T+1)\log_b[\alpha(b-1)+1]\rfloor.
\]
It can be easily proven that the distribution of $i$ conforms to Equation
(\ref{eqn:01}).

So protocols [Bahl 2002,Culler 2001,Zhou 2006,Adya 2001,Culler 2001;
Tzamaloukas-01; Akyildiz-01] that use RTS/CTS
controls\footnote{RTS/CTS controls are required to be implemented by
802.11-compliant devices. They can be used as an optional mechanism
to avoid Hidden Terminal Problems in the 802.11 standard and
protocols based on those similar to [Akyildiz 2001] and
[Adya 2001].} for frequency negotiation and reservation are not
suitable for WSN applications, even though they exhibit good
performance in general wireless ad hoc
networks.

% Head 3
\subsubsection{Exclusive Frequency Assignment}

In exclusive frequency assignment, nodes first exchange their IDs
among two communication hops so that each node knows its two-hop
neighbors' IDs. In the second broadcast, each node beacons all
neighbors' IDs it has collected during the first broadcast period.

% Head 4
\paragraph{Eavesdropping}

Even though the even selection scheme leads to even sharing of
available frequencies among any two-hop neighborhood, it involves a
number of two-hop broadcasts. To reduce the communication cost, we
propose a lightweight eavesdropping scheme.

\subsection{Basic Notations}

As Algorithm~\ref{alg:one} states, for each frequency
number, each node calculates a random number (${\textit{Rnd}}_{\alpha}$) for
itself and a random number (${\textit{Rnd}}_{\beta}$) for each of its two-hop
neighbors with the same pseudorandom number generator.
% Algorithm
\begin{algorithm}[t]
\SetAlgoNoLine
\KwIn{Node $\alpha$'s ID ($ID_{\alpha}$), and node $\alpha$'s
neighbors' IDs within two communication hops.}
\KwOut{The frequency number ($FreNum_{\alpha}$) node $\alpha$ gets assigned.}
$index$ = 0; $FreNum_{\alpha}$ = -1\;
\Repeat{$FreNum_{\alpha} > -1$}{
        $Rnd_{\alpha}$ = Random($ID_{\alpha}$, $index$)\;
        $Found$ = $TRUE$\;
        \For{each node $\beta$ in $\alpha$'s two communication hops
    }{
      $Rnd_{\beta}$ = Random($ID_{\beta}$, $index$)\;
      \If{($Rnd_{\alpha} < Rnd_{\beta}$) \text{or} ($Rnd_{\alpha}$ ==
          $Rnd_{\beta}$ \text{and} $ID_{\alpha} < ID_{\beta}$)\;
      }{
        $Found$ = $FALSE$; break\;
      }
        }

           $FreNum_{\alpha}$ = $index$\;
         }{

Bus masters are divided into two disjoint sets, $\mathcal{M}_{RT}$
and $\mathcal{M}_{NRT}$.
% description
\begin{description}
\item[RT Masters]
$\mathcal{M}_{RT}=\{ \vec{m}_{1},\dots,\vec{m}_{n}\}$ denotes the
$n$ RT masters issuing real-time constrained requests. To model the
current request issued by an $\vec{m}_{i}$ in $\mathcal{M}_{RT}$,
three parameters---the recurrence time $(r_i)$, the service cycle
$(c_i)$, and the relative deadline $(d_i)$---are used, with their
relationships.
\item[NRT Masters]
$\mathcal{M}_{NRT}=\{ \vec{m}_{n+1},\dots,\vec{m}_{n+m}\}$ is a set
of $m$ masters issuing nonreal-time constrained requests. In our
model, each $\vec{m}_{j}$ in $\mathcal{M}_{NRT}$ needs only one
parameter, the service cycle, to model the current request it
issues.
\end{description}

Here, a question may arise, since each node has a global ID. Why
don't we just map nodes' IDs within two hops into a group of
frequency numbers and assign those numbers to all nodes within two
hops?

\section{Simulator}
\label{sec:sim}

If the model checker requests successors of a state which are not
created yet, the state space uses the simulator to create the
successors on-the-fly. To create successor states the simulator
conducts the following steps.
% enumerate
\begin{enumerate}
\item Load state into microcontroller model.
\item Determine assignments needed for resolving nondeterminism.
\item For each assignment.
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item either call interrupt handler or simulate effect of next instruction, or
      \item evaluate truth values of atomic propositions.
      \end{enumerate}
\item Return resulting states.
\end{enumerate}
Figure~\ref{fig:one} shows a typical microcontroller C program that
controls an automotive power window lift. The program is one of the
programs used in the case study described in Section~\ref{sec:sim}.
At first sight, the programs looks like an ANSI~C program. It
contains function calls, assignments, if clauses, and while loops.

\subsection{Problem Formulation}

The objective of variable coalescence-based offset assignment is to find
both the coalescence scheme and the MWPC on the coalesced graph. We start
with a few definitions and lemmas for variable coalescence.

% Enunciations
\begin{definition}[Coalesced Node (C-Node)]A C-node is a set of
live ranges (webs) in the AG or IG that are coalesced. Nodes within the same
C-node cannot interfere with each other on the IG. Before any coalescing is
done, each live range is a C-node by itself.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[C-AG (Coalesced Access Graph)]The C-AG is the access
graph after node coalescence, which is composed of all C-nodes and C-edges.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
The C-MWPC problem is NP-complete.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof} C-MWPC can be easily reduced to the MWPC problem assuming a
coalescence graph without any edge or a fully connected interference graph.
Therefore, each C-node is an uncoalesced live range after value separation
and C-PC is equivalent to PC. A fully connected interference graph is made
possible when all live ranges interfere with each other. Thus, the C-MWPC
problem is NP-complete.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[Lemma Subhead]The solution to the C-MWPC problem is no
worse than the solution to the MWPC.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Simply, any solution to the MWPC is also a solution to the
C-MWPC. But some solutions to C-MWPC may not apply to the MWPC (if any
coalescing were made).
\end{proof}

\section{Performance Evaluation}

During all the experiments, the Geographic Forwarding (GF)
[Akyildiz 2001] routing protocol is used. GF exploits geographic
information of nodes and conducts local data-forwarding to achieve
end-to-end routing. Our simulation is
configured according to the settings in
Table~\ref{tab:one}. Each run lasts for 2 minutes and
repeated 100 times. For each data value we present in the results,
we also give its 90\% confidence interval.

\section{Conclusions}

In this article, we develop the first multifrequency MAC protocol for
WSN applications in which each device adopts a
single radio transceiver. The different MAC design requirements for
WSNs and general wireless ad-hoc networks are
compared, and a complete WSN multifrequency MAC design (MMSN) is
put forth. During the MMSN design, we analyze and evaluate different
choices for frequency assignments and also discuss the nonuniform
back-off algorithms for the slotted media access design.

\section*{APPENDIX}
\setcounter{section}{1}
In this appendix, we measure
the channel switching time of Micaz [CROSSBOW] sensor devices.
In our experiments, one mote alternatingly switches between Channels
11 and 12. Every time after the node switches to a channel, it sends
out a packet immediately and then changes to a new channel as soon
as the transmission is finished. We measure the
number of packets the test mote can send in 10 seconds, denoted as
$N_{1}$. In contrast, we also measure the same value of the test
mote without switching channels, denoted as $N_{2}$. We calculate
the channel-switching time $s$ as
\begin{eqnarray}%
s=\frac{10}{N_{1}}-\frac{10}{N_{2}}. \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}%
By repeating the experiments 100 times, we get the average
channel-switching time of Micaz motes: 24.3$\mu$s.

\section{This is an example of Appendix section head}

Channel-switching time is measured as the time length it takes for
motes to successfully switch from one channel to another. This
parameter impacts the maximum network throughput, because motes
cannot receive or send any packet during this period of time, and it
also affects the efficiency of toggle snooping in MMSN, where motes
need to sense through channels rapidly.

By repeating experiments 100 times, we get the average
channel-switching time of Micaz motes: 24.3 $\mu$s. We then conduct
the same experiments with different Micaz motes, as well as
experiments with the transmitter switching from Channel 11 to other
channels. In both scenarios, the channel-switching time does not have
obvious changes. (In our experiments, all values are in the range of
23.6 $\mu$s to 24.9 $\mu$s.)

\section{Appendix section head}

The primary consumer of energy in WSNs is idle listening. The key to
reduce idle listening is executing low duty-cycle on nodes. Two
primary approaches are considered in controlling duty-cycles in the
MAC layer.
