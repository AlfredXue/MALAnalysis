python-mal: A Python interface to MyAnimeList
=============================================

`python-mal <https://github.com/shaldengeki/python-mal>`_ is a Python library for interacting programmatically with resources on `MyAnimeList <http://myanimelist.net>`_. 

Confusingly enough, the package is called ``python-mal`` while the module itself is named ``myanimelist``. The docs will refer to ``python-mal`` whenever we talk about the package, e.g. installing it, but for anything else, e.g. actual code, we'll refer to ``myanimelist``.

All features are tested under Python 2.7.

Getting Started
---------------

If you've never used ``myanimelist`` before, you should read the :doc:`Getting Started with myanimelist <getting_started>` guide to get familiar with ``myanimelist``.
